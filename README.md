GitHUb Tutorial Repository
My name is Scott. I am fairly new to coding in general. I have some basic knowledge of Python and have completed several tutorial/learning projects for the Python language. Most recently, I am looking to learn more about game development and buliding my skills with programs such as Blender, Defold, and Geany.
I am also learning to use GITHUB with my projects.
